🎮✨ Step 1: Environment Creation 🎨🌱

Welcome to the world of EE! 🛠️ EE (Enviroment Editor) is the magical app that I built to create multi-layered grid environments 🏞️. 
It's where the agent does its thing! Think of it as a playground for the agent—each layer in this world has a unique role.

🎯 Layer Breakdown:

Layer 2 (Roads) 🛤️: Paths where the agent can freely roam.
Layer 3 (Target) 🎯: The ultimate goal for our little agent.
Layer 5 (Agent) 🤖: This is where the agent lives, moves, and grooves.
Layer 8 (Obstacles) ⛔: Challenges the agent must overcome.
Decorative Layers 🌳🏡: Just some visuals to make the world look pretty!

🤖✨ Step 2: Agent Design 🛠️

Time to meet our Agent! 🦾 It’s got personality and a bunch of cool properties and methods to help it move, navigate, and explore its world. Here's what makes our agent tick:

Image 🎨: A stylish sprite to represent the agent.
X, Y Coordinates 📍: Where in the grid world it shows up.
Scale 📏: Size it up, size it down, we got this!
Tile Size 🔳: This is the pixel magic that helps the agent find its perfect spot on the screen.
But wait, there’s more! The agent's got some serious skills when it comes to moving, drawing itself, and checking for valid moves. 🕺💥

🔄✨ Step 3: Agent Simulation Loop 🌀

This agent never sleeps! 🛌💤 Every 30 FPS, it updates itself, moving and grooving across the environment in real time! 🕰️⚡

🚀✨ Step 4: Pathfinding Enhancement 🛤️🔍

Here’s where things get next-level! 💡 We’ve taken pathfinding to new heights with BFS (Breadth-First Search)! 📚✨ It helps the agent navigate in the most efficient way possible, finding the shortest path with ease.

📊 Comparison of Pathfinding Methods:

Feature	Original Code	Enhanced Code (BFS)
Movement	Random choices 🎲	Prioritizes shortest path 🚀
Efficiency	Some backtracking 🔄	Less backtracking 🔥
Best Use Case	Small grids 🏞️	Complex grids with obstacles 🏙️
The enhanced code reduces random movements, so the agent reaches its goal faster and with fewer detours! 🚴‍♂️💨
